        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I’ve been a long time Paramedic and EMT. Over the last 11 years I have worked the 911 systems spanning over 50 different cities and 3 states. Starting at the age of 18 I worked as an EMT in the greater Los Angeles area for numerous years.
          My career later took me to Massachusetts where I operated as a senior EMT mentoring the new hires in the greater Boston area. I later attended Paramedic School in Riverside CA, and after rigorous testing I recieved my license in 2016. I have been working as a Paramedic
          in the San Bernardino area ever since.</p>
        <p>After thousands of patients treated over the years, it is now time to move on. I may lack web development experience, but my time as a paramedic has taught me how to learn at an accelerated rate as well as execute my tasks quickly and efficiently. Believe it or not, but emergency treatment
          is primarily comprised of customer service. Regardless of how stressful a situation may be, this experience allows me to stay professional, calm, and respectful at all times.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>Over the years I have had rare opportunities to experience many extraordinary events. Here's a short list:</p>
        <ul class="fun-facts">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">I have delivered 5 babies</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">I have been the last person numerous people have spoken to in their lives</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">I have seen people come back from the dead</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">I've seen a man's dentures somehow stop a bullet from killing him... The dentures didn't survive</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">We don't shock a patient who's "flat-lining" like they do in the movies</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">Blood has a smell </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">The picture above is a 911 call that I was on. The two occupants did survive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So many instances while working in this field have helped craft the man I am today, and I will always look back on them fondly.</p>
